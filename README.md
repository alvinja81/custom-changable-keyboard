this road map taken from chat-gpt : 
Sure, here is a general roadmap for making an iOS keyboard app:

Choose the development platform: Decide on the programming language and development environment you want to use such as Swift or Objective-C, and Xcode as the IDE.

Plan your keyboard design: Design your keyboard layout and decide the characters you want to include. You can use design tools like Sketch, Figma, or Adobe Illustrator for this.

Implement the keyboard functionality: Write and test the code for keyboard functionality, such as detecting key presses, displaying characters, and handling user inputs.

Use App Groups: To use your custom keyboard in other iOS apps, you'll need to create an App Group and share data between your keyboard extension and main app.

Integrate with iOS: Your keyboard app must be integrated with iOS. You will need to create an app extension and configure it to work with your main app.

Testing and debugging: Thoroughly test your keyboard app across multiple iOS devices and different use cases.

Submit to the App Store: After testing and debugging, submit your keyboard app to the App Store for review and distribution.

Keep in mind that this is a general roadmap, and the process of making an iOS keyboard app can be complex and time-consuming. You may face some unique challenges along the way, such as ensuring your app is secure, compatible with different iOS versions, and meets Apple's strict guidelines. Thus, It's recommended that you have some experience in iOS development or work with an experienced developer or development team to ensure your success.
